- ‚úÖ Email and status-based lookups
- ‚úÖ User statistics and search functionality

### üîß Technical Architecture Implemented:

**JWT Authentication Flow:**

```
1. User registers/logs in ‚Üí Credentials validated
2. JWT token generated with user info and roles
3. Client stores token and sends in Authorization header
4. JwtAuthenticationFilter validates token on each request
5. Spring Security sets authentication context
6. Role-based access control applied to endpoints
```

**Security Configuration:**

- **Stateless Authentication**: JWT tokens, no server sessions
- **CORS Configuration**: Frontend integration support
- **Role-Based URLs**: Different access levels per endpoint
- **Password Security**: BCrypt hashing with salt

### üí° Interview Key Points:

**Q: "How does JWT authentication work in your system?"**
**A**: "I implemented a stateless JWT-based authentication system:

- **Token Generation**: User credentials are validated and JWT contains user ID, email, and role
- **Token Validation**: Each request is intercepted by JwtAuthenticationFilter
- **Security Context**: Valid tokens set Spring Security authentication context
- **Role-Based Access**: @PreAuthorize annotations and URL patterns control access
- **Refresh Mechanism**: Separate refresh tokens for extended sessions"

**Q: "How do you handle security vulnerabilities?"**
**A**: "Multiple security layers are implemented:

- **Password Security**: BCrypt hashing with configurable strength
- **Token Security**: JWT signed with HMAC-SHA256 and expiration times
- **Input Validation**: Bean validation on all DTOs
- **CORS Policy**: Configured for specific origins only
- **Exception Handling**: No sensitive information exposed in error messages"

**Q: "Explain your role-based access control"**
**A**: "I implemented hierarchical role-based access:

- **Three Roles**: STUDENT, INSTRUCTOR, ADMIN
- **Inheritance**: Instructors can access student endpoints, admins access all
- **URL Security**: Different endpoints protected based on roles
- **Method Security**: @PreAuthorize annotations for fine-grained control
- **Dynamic Permissions**: UserPrincipal provides role checking methods"

### üéØ Module 2 Benefits:

1. **Security**: Enterprise-grade authentication with JWT
2. **Scalability**: Stateless authentication supports horizontal scaling
3. **Flexibility**: Role-based access control for different user types
4. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of security concerns
